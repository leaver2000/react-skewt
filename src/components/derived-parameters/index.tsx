 * This section interprets most of those values and gives operational significance to the values. Each parameter or indice will be broken down one by one. In a severe weather situations and during inclement weather, these indices come in handy. The indices should be used as guides. Often, indices will contradict each other and can change rapidly in the course of a couple of hours. An experienced meteorologist is well informed to how a sounding will change throughout the day and why some sounding indices are better than others in certain situations. Soundings are most notably changed through thermal advection, moisture advection, and evaporational cooling. Modified soundings should be studied along with the standard 12Z and 00Z sounding.
